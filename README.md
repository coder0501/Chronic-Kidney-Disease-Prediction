Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction
This is a machine learning project that is trained on a collected data of people who are infected by these disease and some other people.
It includes a lot of data about the individual and I used that feature to make an optimal model that will predict if someone is suffering from this disease or not.


What is Chronic Kidney Disease?
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood the way they should. The disease is called “chronic” because the damage to your kidneys happens slowly over a long period of time. This damage can cause wastes to build up in your body. CKD can also cause other health problems. Source


What causes Chronic Kidney Disease?
The two most common causes of CKD are diabetes and high blood pressure. Diabetes means that your blood sugar is too high, which can damage your kidneys. High blood pressure means that the force of blood in your blood vessels is too strong, which can damage your blood vessels and lead to CKD.

Motivation:

As mentioned above how the CKD is a global problem. CKD does not show obvious symptoms in its early stages. Therefore, the disease may not be detected until the kidney loses about 25% of its function. In addition, CKD has high morbidity and mortality, with a global impact on the human body. It can induce the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. Hence, the prediction and diagnosis of CKD in its early stages is quite essential.
